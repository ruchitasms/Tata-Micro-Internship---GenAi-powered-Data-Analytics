# 💼 Tata GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Micro-Internship

An end-to-end data product built to predict **Customer Delinquency Risk**, combining data science, business strategy, and responsible AI deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This micro-internship with Tata involved designing and delivering a full-stack AI solution for financial risk prediction. The project was divided into four key stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified key risk drivers and behavioral patterns  
   - Visualized trends in missed payments, credit utilization, and income

2. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Trained a Decision Tree classifier with:
     - **85% Accuracy**
     - **0.88 AUC-ROC**
   - Applied SMOTE and class weighting to address imbalance and bias

3. **Business Strategy & Recommendations**  
   - Delivered SMART recommendations for stakeholder action  
   - Proposed a financial literacy campaign with **5–10× ROI potential**  
   - Identified high-risk youth segment (3× more likely to default)

4. **Agentic AI System Design**  
   - Created a scalable, ethical collections strategy  
   - Integrated fairness, explainability, and compliance guardrails  
   - Outlined autonomous vs. human-in-the-loop decision flows
